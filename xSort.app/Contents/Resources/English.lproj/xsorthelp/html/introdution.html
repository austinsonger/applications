It allows you to easily define a new card sorting problem, perform several sessions with multiple participants, and finally analyze the results (using multiple criteria) and generate printable reports.</p><h2 id="new">What's new in version 1.6.1?</h2><ul>	<li>Maintenance release to fix some issues with Mac OS X Snow Leopard.</li></ul><h2 id="features">Features</h2><ul><li>Supports open, semi-open and closed exercises.</li><li>Supports sub-groups.</li><li>Handles participant profiles.</li><li>Complete graphical environment for performing exercises, simulating a zoomable table with cards.
